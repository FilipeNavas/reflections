- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I'm working in a team or some sort of project that i need to keep track of veersions.

- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Because u can be working on a feature and dont wanna lose it, so u pull changes after commiting.

- Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  Fork is a clone only on GitHub, clone is when u copy a repository locally and branches are different 'paths' of ur changes/commits.
