- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I'm working in a team or some sort of project that i need to keep track of veersions.

- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Because u can be working on a feature and dont wanna lose it, so u pull changes after commiting.

- Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  Fork is a clone only on GitHub, clone is when u copy a repository locally and branches are different 'paths' of ur changes/commits.

  - What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  In case u want to go back to that commit. 

  - How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
    It would be locally, where all the people are together or sth like that. But git and github provides a flexibility to have people all over the world
    sharing changes in a project, and it is very easy to keep track of versions.
