Lesson 2 Reflection

- I'm awesome!

- Git init -> used to initialize a git repository
- Git status -> used to see the status of a repository


- How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's a temporary area wheere u put the files to be comitted.


- How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can see if there are any changes from the last commit or/and the working directory, so u can make sure to commit or not.


-What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

With branches u can add a new feature, try sth new in the project,  have different teams developing different features and so on.

-How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It makes easier to see which branch u are and which ones are reachable.

-What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

You have the code from both branches into one. To facilitate the understanding


- What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
  
   It's good do it manually so u can talk to the other developer to keep the changes that must be kept. If it's automatically, u might
   have merged sth u didnt want to keep, and lost the code u wnanted.
