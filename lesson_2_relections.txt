Lesson 2 Reflection

- I'm awesome!

- Git init -> used to initialize a git repository
- Git status -> used to see the status of a repository


- How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's a temporary area wheere u put the files to be comitted.


- How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can see if there are any changes from the last commit or/and the working directory, so u can make sure to commit or not.
