- Git init -> used to initialize a git repository
- Git status -> used to see the status of a repository


- How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's a temporary area wheere u put the files to be comitted.


- How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can see if there are any changes from the last commit or/and the working directory, so u can make sure to commit or not.


-What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

With branches u can add a new feature, try sth new in the project,  have different teams developing different features and so on.

-How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It makes easier to see which branch u are and which ones are reachable.
